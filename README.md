#About The LawGen Project

This is a project started for The LawGen project. 

The idea is to create a knowledgebase mixed into a forum, and a social platform. 

The structure will feature some of the following:

 - Help you find solutions to problems
 
 - Help you plan events in your community
 
 - Extend Democracy in your community. 
 
 - And much much more. 
 
 
#Open Source Importance. 

To make the global outreach farther and more in depth, we have decided to leave this project open source. 

The idea is to allow everyone participate in a society. Whether it is writing grants, or helping someone find a job - The Lawgen project is about helping each other and thriving in society. Ending violence - and making the world a better place. 

You can use this project for your project. 

While the project is only starting, a release will be out soon.
